            <h1>Kanban-inspired task tracker</h1>
            <p>Managing tasks is a central part of day to day life, but it often feels difficult.</p>
            <p>I wanted to create an app that makes creating and managing tasks easy.</p>
            <p>An offline task board that supports both keyboard navigation and drag-and-drop behavior.</p>
            <p>While this app might not be able to instantly cure procrastination, it can help manage tasks more effectively.</p>

                    <h2>Initial designs</h2>
                </header>
                <p>The goal was a task board representing three states: To Do, Work in Progress, and Completed.</p>
                <p>Early sketches explored different layout and card compositions.</p>
                <img src="./../assets/kanban-sketch.png" alt="Early sketch of a kanban board">
                <p>From these explorations, I decided on a three-sectioned layout with minimal card controls, prioritizing clarity and keyboard accessibility.</p>
                <p>This decision was translated into a low-fidelity Figma prototype to further validate the structure and flow between the components.</p>
                <p>It's purpose is to allow immediate implementation rather than visual polish, ensuring the design can be built without ambiguity.</p>

                    <h2>Interactions as a primary feature</h2>
                </header>
                <p>A core challenge was balancing drag-and-drop behavior with a keyboard-first workflow.</p>
                <p>Tasks can be moved between columns using either method, without one feeling like a secondary or compromised experience.</p>
                <p class="sub-heading">Implementing keyboard-first interactions</p>
                <p>I decided to add two arrow buttons on the bottom of each task card.</p>
                <p>The design is made to be intuitive, requiring no additional visual hints.</p>
                <p>Focus states are refined to look visually appealing while still being accessible.</p>

                <p class="sub-heading">Implementing drag-and-drop</p>
                <p>I used react-dnd to implement custom drag-and-drop features.</p>
                <p>The cards act as a draggable object, and the columns act as drop targets, allowing smooth movement between columns.</p>
                <p>Both interaction methods update the same state, ensuring consistent behavior regardless of input.</p>

                    <h2>Adding a tag system</h2>
                </header>
                <p>Each task includes a tag, visually represented as a small dot at the upper right corner of each task card.</p>
                <p>Tags can be set to Low, Medium, High, or left uncategorized, and intentionally do not carry a predefined meaning.</p>
                <p>Rather than hard-coding labels such as "difficulty", interpretation is left to the user. A tag can represent priority, effort, estimated time, or other personal criteria.</p>

                <p>The tags are a central part of the app. For you, what would the tags represent best?</p>
