            <p>Recipe applications are abundant, but many overwhelm users with complex layouts and excessive interactions.</p>
            <p>I wanted to create an alternative, where simplicity is favored over feature count.</p>
            <p>The UI must be minimal and accessible, making the app intuitive and easy to use.</p>
            <p>The UX must be responsive, demonstrating clear error handling and empty states.</p>
            <p>Lastly, the application must integrate with an API without compromising performance and predictability.</p>

                    <h2>Designing the layout</h2>
                </header>
                <p>The application is designed as a two page system, featuring a home page and a reading page.</p>
                <p>The home page allows users to browse recipes easily, displaying three thumbnails per page.</p>
                <p>Search is integrated directly into this flow, allowing users to refine the results based on personal requirements.</p>

                <p>Clicking on a thumbnail leads to the reading page, which displays the recipe's ingredients and instructions, offering a focused reading experience.</p>

                    <h2>Making a reliable UX</h2>
                </header>
                <p>Two things are done to keep the app stable and performant:</p>
                <p>Search input is debounced to prevent unnecessary API calls, while results are cached to avoid redundant requests. </p>
                <p>This makes the behavior more consistent and provides a faster experience when revisiting searches.</p>
                <img src="./../assets/recipe-search-gif.gif" alt="Debounced search demonstration" class="captioned-img very-small-img">
                <p class="img-caption">After the user finishes typing, the API is called only after a small delay.</p>
                <p>Alongside that, all states of the application is accounted for:</p>
                <p>1. Loading states communicate progress without breaking the UI</p>
                <p>2. Error states are clear and non-disruptive</p>
                <p>3. Buttons are disabled when actions are unavailable</p>

                    <h2>Adding a read-mode modal</h2>
                </header>
                <p>Rather than navigating to a separate page, information about a recipe is displayed in a read-mode modal.</p>
                <p>This allows users to keep the current browsing context while shifting the focus toward the recipe's details.</p>

                </header>
                <p>By limiting the complexity, the app remains simple and reliable without depending on feature count.</p>
                <p>This was an important learning experience, as it taught me that apps don't need to be complex to be useful.</p>
                <p>As long as it is supported by the right structure, even one core feature is enough.</p>
